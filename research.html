                <h3>Chemotherapy Resistance</h3>
                <p>
                    This master's thesis project was supervised by 
                    <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=EjcaOAgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Francisco E. Bautista Redonda</a> 
                    and 
                    <a href="https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=7rwSUD4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Luis A. Salazar Olivo</a> 
                    at IPICyT. The objective was to verify if the terpenes derived from the 
                    <em>Jatropha dioica</em> plant had the capacity to modulate resistance to chemotherapy in resistant breast cells.
                    <br><br>
                    The project included a research stay at UNAM in Mexico City, supervised by 
                    <a href="https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=DggYk6IAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Rogelio Pereda Miranda</a>. 
                    During the stay, I cultivated cell lines of different cancers, including colon, cervix, prostate, and mouse leukemia. 
                    The focus was on vinblastine-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7), developed by our team, and exploring the potential of plants used in traditional Mexican medicine to discover new therapeutic targets.

                    The research led to the publication of a new molecule, which was identified during the study. Below is an image of the molecule:

                <h3>Antibiotic Resistance</h3>
                <p>
                    Our work in antibiotic resistance focuses on the importance of building a comprehensive genomics library for these bacteria. 
                    This project is a collaboration between the university and the health institute to address critical public health challenges.

                <h3>COVID-19 Mutations</h3>
                <p>
                    During the sequencing of COVID-19 strains from deceased patients, we found that the Delta variant was the most prevalent lineage associated with deaths in 2021-2022. 
                    The B.1.1.529 lineages emerged in mid-2022, and currently, the XBB lineage is the most commonly identified in Mexico.
                    <br><br>
                    New mutations L95M and L46M in ORF 8 and ORF 9 were discovered in 30% and 20% of the sequences, respectively. 
                    These mutations are positively associated with patient death and provide crucial insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the region.
